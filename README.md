# Driver-Monitoring-System-
🚦 Built My First Real-Time Driver Monitoring System! 🧠📹
During an exciting 3-week hands-on Python workshop at VIT, Vellore, I developed a smart vision-based tool designed to help drivers stay focused and safe behind the wheel.

🔧 What I created:
A real-time Driver Monitoring System that uses a simple webcam and Python to analyze driver attention and respond instantly.

🛠️ Core Features:
👁️ Eye & face tracking using MediaPipe
🔊 Sound alarm system when distraction is detected
📉 Real-time monitoring with distraction scoring
📄 Automatically generates a clean PDF behavior report
📦 Built using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and FPDF

🎯 Why it matters:
Even a 2-second glance away from the road can be dangerous. This system shows how accessible tech and Python can help solve real-world problems like road safety.
